I like to thank Parrot S.A. for providing an AR.Drone for the competition.
I like to thank Carsten van Weelden for his experiments to validate the motion model of the AR.Drone. 
Martijn van der Veen and Robrecht Jurriaans took the initiative to compete in the IMAV competition and did both independent research on obstacle avoidance \cite{Jurriaans2011} and force field navigation \cite{VanDerVeen2011}.
