\textbf{TODO}
This article describes a method to develop a generic approach to
acquire navigation capabilities for the standard platform of the IMAV indoor competition: the Parrot AR.Drone.
Our development is partly based on simulation, which requires both a realistic sensor and motion model.
%The simulation models we used are described and validated.
The AR.Drone simulation model is described and validated.
Furthermore, this article describes how a visual map of the indoor environment can be made, including the effect of sensor noise.
This visual map consists of a texture map and a feature map. The texture map is used for human navigation and the feature map is used by the AR.Drone to localize itself.
To do so, a localization method is presented.
An experiment demonstrates how well the localization works for circumstances encountered during the IMAV competition. 
%Validation results for the simulation model are presented.
%On this basis, it should be possible to learn elevation maps, optimal paths on this visual map and to autonomously avoid obstacles based on optical flow.
